    The Fear The Wall (FTW) Ratings Tracker is a web app that allows you to
    explore the player ratings given to each player, by the FTW writers,
    after every Borussia Dortmund match.

    The app contains a page for individual player ratings, as well as a
    page for exploring overall team performance, and a page for comparing
    players against each other (so that you can make a case that the guy
    you don't like is actually terrible and belongs in the bin).
